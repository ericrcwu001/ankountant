## Upstream Acknowledgments

Ankountant is built on top of work by:

- **[Damien Elmes](https://github.com/dae)** and the [ankitects/anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki) project — the Rust backend that powers all card scheduling, sync, template rendering, and persistence in this app.
- **[AnkiDroid](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android)** — the original mobile Anki client and the reference for bridging the Rust backend to a mobile platform.
