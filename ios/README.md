Ankountant wraps the official [ankitects/anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki) Rust backend via C FFI, giving you a native SwiftUI experience backed by the same battle-tested engine that powers Anki Desktop and AnkiDroid. Sync your decks with any compatible sync server (including self-hosted), study with FSRS scheduling, and keep your review history in perfect sync across all your devices.

## Features

- **Sync Server Support** -- login, sync, full upload/download, bidirectional review sync with any compatible server
- **FSRS Scheduling** -- powered by the official Rust FSRS engine, not a reimplementation
- **Card Rendering** -- Rust template engine renders cards exactly like desktop clients
- **Deck Browser** -- hierarchical deck tree with recursive `DisclosureGroup` expand/collapse, new/learn/review count badges on every node
- **Study Session** -- answer cards with Again/Hard/Good/Easy; next-interval labels shown above each button
- **Note Browser** -- search notes across all decks, deck filter chips (top-level decks auto-include subdecks), lazy-load results (50 per page)
- **Note Editor** -- edit note fields with accurate field names from the Rust notetype RPC
- **Statistics Dashboard** -- full-year review heatmap (auto-scrolls to today), streak counter, retention rate, forecast chart, card count breakdown
- **Reader** -- read books from your collection chapter-by-chapter; tap any word for a Yomitan-compatible dictionary lookup; chained popups, search history, per-dictionary collapsed memory; TTS speak button with language-aware voice selection; bundled Korean fonts (Sarasa Mono K, Nanum Myeongjo, Nanum Gothic); vertical writing mode and Latin/CJK auto-detection; cross-device progress sync
- **Multi-Profile Accounts** -- isolated Anki collections per profile, fast picker in the decks toolbar, per-profile sync credentials and review history
- **Image Occlusion** -- create and edit notes with rectangle, ellipse, polygon, and text masks; reviewer parity with upstream Anki
- **Multi-Theme System** -- Vivid + Muted palettes, Light/Dark/Follow-System; persists across app and home-screen widgets via App Group
- **Per-Deck Study Options** -- FSRS weights editor with optimizer + simulator, preset CRUD, Easy Days, bury rules, timer, auto-advance
- **Offline-First** -- everything works offline; sync when you have a connection
- **Swift 6.2 Strict Concurrency** -- zero data races, fully actor-isolated, `Sendable` throughout

## Architecture

```
SwiftUI Views
    |
@DependencyClient structs
    |
AnkiBackend (Swift wrapper)
    |
C FFI (4 functions)
    |
Rust static library (ankitects/anki)
```

Swift owns the UI. Rust owns everything else -- database, sync, FSRS scheduling, card templates, statistics.

For the full architecture walkthrough, see **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## Requirements

| Tool             | Version            |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| iOS              | 17.0+              |
| Xcode            | 16.0+              |
| Rust             | 1.92+ (via rustup) |
| protoc           | 3.0+               |
| protoc-gen-swift | latest             |
| xcodegen         | latest             |

## Getting Started

The iOS client lives in the [`ankountant`](https://github.com/ericrcwu001/ankountant) monorepo under `ios/`, alongside the shared Rust core (`rslib/`) it builds against.

### 1. Clone the monorepo

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ericrcwu001/ankountant.git
cd ankountant/ios
```

The Rust backend is **not** a submodule — `ios/anki-bridge-rs` links `rslib/` directly as an in-repo path dependency. The `--recursive` flag pulls the repo's Fluent translation submodules (`ftl/`), which `rslib` compiles into the framework.

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Rust toolchain
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim x86_64-apple-ios

# Protobuf compiler and Swift plugin
brew install protobuf swift-protobuf

# Xcode project generator
brew install xcodegen
```

### 3. Build the Rust XCFramework

```bash
./scripts/build-xcframework.sh
```

This cross-compiles the Rust bridge for iOS device and simulator, then packages both into `AnkiRust.xcframework`. The first build takes several minutes; incremental builds are fast.

### 4. Generate Swift protobuf types

```bash
./scripts/generate-protos.sh
```

### 5. Open in Xcode

```bash
cd AnkountantApp && xcodegen generate && cd ..
open AnkountantApp/AnkountantApp.xcodeproj
```

### 6. Build and Run

Select an iOS Simulator or device, then build and run (Cmd+R).

## Tech Stack

- **UI**: SwiftUI with strict concurrency (Swift 6.2, language mode v6)
- **Dependency Injection**: [swift-dependencies](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies) (`@DependencyClient` struct-closure pattern)
- **Backend**: [ankitects/anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki) Rust crate via C FFI
- **Serialization**: Protocol Buffers (24 .proto service definitions)
- **Database**: SQLite (owned by Rust backend)
- **Build**: SPM for library modules, xcodegen for the app target

## Acknowledgments

Ankountant's iOS client began as a fork of **[antigluten/amgi](https://github.com/antigluten/amgi)** by **[Vladimir Gusev](https://github.com/antigluten)**, and would not exist without that groundwork. It has since been integrated into the `ankountant` monorepo and now builds against this repo's shared Rust core.

- **[Vladimir Gusev](https://github.com/antigluten)** and the [antigluten/amgi](https://github.com/antigluten/amgi) project — the original iOS client this app is built upon
- **[Damien Elmes](https://github.com/dae)** and the [ankitects/anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki) contributors for the Rust backend that powers this app
- **[DreamAfar](https://github.com/DreamAfar)** for the v0.0.3/v0.0.4 forks of amgi that contributed Image Occlusion, the multi-theme system, the Settings tab, the card template editor, retrievability stats, tag management, the rich note editor, and the GitHub Actions IPA workflow
